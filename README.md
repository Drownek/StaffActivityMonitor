A simple, efficient, and highly customizable Bukkit plugin for tracking staff activity.

## Usage
All players with permission `staffactivity.staff` are tracked by the plugin.
That includes messages/commands sent and times at which the player was online.

## Commands

`/staffactivity top` - Opens the activity top GUI showing staff activity rankings

`/staffactivity view` - Opens the activity list GUI showing all staff activities

`/staffactivity view <player>` - Opens the activity view for a specific player

`/staffactivity reload` - Reloads the plugin configuration files  

## Permissions

`staffactivity.staff` - Required permission for the plugin to track staff members

`staffactivity.commands` - Required permission to use all plugin commands

## Installation for proxy servers
